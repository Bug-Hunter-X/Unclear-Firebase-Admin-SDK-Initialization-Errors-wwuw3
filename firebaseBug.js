The Firebase Admin SDK's `initializeApp()` function throws an error if the service account credentials are not correctly configured.  This can manifest in various ways, such as a `'credential' is not a function` error, or other errors related to authentication failures. The error messages are not always clear about the root cause being incorrect credentials.  A common mistake is to incorrectly specify the path to the service account key file, or to use the wrong key file altogether. Another less obvious problem is the key file might have insufficient permissions.
